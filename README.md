### Start here for GA
The parameter files are located in the directory  io/params/ and the main class is in ec.main.Run.
Three tutorials have been set up and can be found in the directories

1. io/params/tutorial1-ga-tsp/ 
2. io/params/tutorial1-ant-tsp/ 
3. io/params/tutorial1-alps-tsp/ 

A brief introduction is given to setting up **1** and **3**.
